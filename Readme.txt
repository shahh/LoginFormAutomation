The project in this repository consists of writing test cases for the testing of a login form (suppose that the usermname is "test_automation101" and password is "12345678"). Each case is numbered LOG-1 through LOG-11 in the document TestCases.xlsx. See first this document so you can understand the bigger picture. After writing the test cases they are automated using Selenium WD and Java. In order to use the code, download Selenium WD for Java (a set of .jar files that you need to add to the BuildPath library) at "http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/" and copy the code in your IDE. You need Java installed ("http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html"), create JAVA_HOME environmental variable that holds the path to your java\jdk folder. In your Path variable you can do the following: "%JAVA_HOME%\bin"
